# NeuralNetwork
Implementation of  basic neural network algorithms in C++. This project was developed as an exercise to understand basic neural network algorithms, such as backpropagation and gradient descent. Later,
Later, it was used for a class assignment.
The project was written from scratch using only the standard C++ library and intel vector intrinsics to speed up the computation. It supports AVX256, AVX512, and standard scalar arithmetics.
